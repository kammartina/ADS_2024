"""
SUDOKU SOLVER in Python:
1. Understand the Sudoku Puzzle: A standard Sudoku puzzle consists of a 9x9 grid divided into 9 smaller 3x3 boxes.
The goal is to fill the grid so that each row, column, and 3x3 box contains all of the digits from 1 to 9.
2. Represent the Puzzle in Python: Use a two-dimensional list (list of lists) to represent the Sudoku grid in Python.
Empty cells can be represented by zeros.
3. Find an Empty Space: Search the Sudoku grid to find an empty space (represented by 0 or another placeholder).
4. Attempt to Place Digits: Try placing digits 1 through 9 in that empty space.
5. Check Validity: Check if the current digit placement follows the Sudoku rules:
    No duplicate digits in the current row.
    No duplicate digits in the current column.
    No duplicate digits in the current 3x3 subgrid.
6. Recursive Backtracking:
    If the digit is valid, recursively attempt to fill the next empty space using the same algorithm.
    If the digit leads to no valid placement down the line (dead end), backtrack by replacing the digit with the placeholder again and try the next digit.
7. Solution Found or Not Possible:
    If all empty spaces are filled validly, a solution is found.
    If no digits are valid for an empty space, the Sudoku puzzle is unsolvable with the current placements, indicating backtracking is needed.
8. Repeat: Continue this process until the entire grid is filled.
9. Test Your Solver: Test your program with different Sudoku puzzles to ensure it works correctly.
Remember, the key to solving Sudoku with a program is the backtracking algorithm, which tries all possible numbers in
an empty cell until the puzzle is solved or it backtracks to try a different number.
